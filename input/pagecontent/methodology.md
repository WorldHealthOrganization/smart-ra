# Methodology

One of the core **principles** guiding this architecture is that **architecture SHALL be accessible to stakeholders**.

This means:

- **Business Architecture** must be readable and understandable by **business leaders and domain experts**.
- Stakeholders **should not need prior knowledge** of technical frameworks like TOGAF or specific modeling languages to engage with the architectural content.

To support this, we emphasize:

- **Plain-language definitions**
- **Layered explanations**, separating business intent from technical implementation
- **Clear, consistent diagrams**, with minimal jargon

## Structure and Maintainability

While accessibility is essential, so is **discipline**.

Architectural descriptions must be:

- **Structured**: Organized by consistent concepts (goals, capabilities, components, services)
- **Maintainable**: Designed to evolve as the enterprise changes
- **Machine-readable**: Where possible, enabling reuse, validation, and integration
- **Coherent**: Diagrams and text should form a **unified model**, not scattered or contradictory fragments

To achieve this, we use:

- **TOGAF** as a conceptual framework for organizing architectural domains and layers
- **ArchiMate** notation (via [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/archimate-diagrams)) for visual modeling
- A **structured substrate**: defined concepts (e.g., Goal, Capability, Application Component) are reused across views
- **FHIR (HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** for aligning with healthcare data standards and integrating architectural elements into real-world systems

## Integration with Standards

This architecture connects directly to **healthcare interoperability standards**, enabling it to be:

- **Semantic**: Using FHIR resources and vocabularies for consistency with health data models
- **Pragmatic**: Able to inform and validate system implementation
- **Extensible**: Supporting layered architectures that evolve with health system needs

We use FHIR not just for data modeling, but also to **link architecture elements** (e.g., client registry capability → `Patient` resource → integration profiles like IHE PIXm).

## Summary

This methodology balances **clarity for stakeholders** with **rigor for implementers**.

- Readers should be able to understand **what the architecture means**.
- Designers should be able to trace **why a component exists** and **how it connects**.
- Tools should be able to **analyze, validate, and extend** the model.

By grounding our work in **TOGAF, ArchiMate, and FHIR**, we ensure our architecture is:
- **Understandable**
- **Maintainable**
- **Standardized**
- **Connected to real-world health IT**
