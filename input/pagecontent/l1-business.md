# Business Layer

The **Business Layer** defines the strategic and operational foundations of an enterprise. It describes what the organization aims to achieve, how it organizes its operations, and which actors or roles carry out those operations. This layer is independent of technology and focuses on goals, responsibilities, processes, and capabilities.

It serves as the foundation for aligning information systems and technology with the organizationâ€™s mission and value delivery.

---

## Purpose

The Business Layer answers the questions:

- **Why** does the organization exist?
- **What** does it want to achieve?
- **How** does it operate to achieve that?
- **Who** is involved in those operations?

These concerns are captured through key architectural concepts.

## Illustrative Example: Client Registry

To make these concepts more concrete, the following example shows how they can be applied in the context of a **Client Registry**, which enables unique identification of patients across healthcare services.
